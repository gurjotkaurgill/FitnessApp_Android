**Project Description:** Developed an Android application using Java in Android Studio, aimed at assisting users in finding exercises based on various search criteria and saving their favorite exercises to a local database for convenient access. The app utilized data retrieved from ExerciseDB via RapidAPI and integrated features such as exercise search functionality, detailed exercise information display with demo GIFs, and the ability to save and remove favorite exercises. The application ensured state persistence during device rotation to enhance user experience.

**Action Steps:**
• Integrated data retrieval from the ExerciseDB API provided by RapidAPI to fetch exercise information.
• Implemented a user-friendly interface allowing users to search for exercises using multiple criteria including exercise name, target muscle group, target body part, or required equipment.
• Utilized Recycler View to display search results in a list format, providing easy navigation and access to exercise details.
• Enhanced user engagement by providing detailed exercise information upon selection, including demo GIFs for visual demonstration.
• Implemented a Room database to store and manage favourite exercises, enabling users to save and remove exercises for future reference.
• Incorporated dynamic UI elements such as a filled heart button indicating a favourite exercise and an outline heart button for non-favourites.
• Implemented search functionality within the local database to facilitate easy retrieval of saved exercises.
• Ensured application state persistence during device rotation using savedInstanceState and app-level variables.

**Results:** Successfully delivered a fully functional fitness application meeting project requirements and achieving a perfect grade of 100%.
This project showcases proficiency in Android app development using Java, integration of external APIs, database management, user interface design, and state management techniques for improved user experience.
